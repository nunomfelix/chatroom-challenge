- Add a user to a room
- Send a message to a room
- Get the latest messages from a room

## Additional Features
- Automated tests to verify the correct behavior of the API
- OpenAPI documentation
- Dockerized application

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
  yarn install
```

## Configuration

Before start install PostgreSQL and fill correct configurations in .env file
```bash
#if you are using docker
DB_HOST=database
DB_PORT=5432

DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_DATABASE=colkie
#else 
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres

Some helper script to work with database
